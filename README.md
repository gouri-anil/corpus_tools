# corpus_tools
A program that processes several different corpora through the use of three tools: string replacer, word length matcher, and a concordance tool. 

# What are the tools used?
String replacer tool is a versatile utility that can be used in a wide range of scenarios where you need to replace specific strings or patterns with other strings or patterns. It can save time, reduce errors, and improve consistency in various text-related tasks. Some of the uses are Find and replace in Text Documents, Code refactoring, and textual automation.

Length matching tool can help with word games, password generation, language learning, text analysis, and poetry and literature. They can help find the words of same number of letters which helps us understand the morphology and syntax of the corpus.

A concordance tool is used to analyse and display the occurrences of a specific word or phrase within a text or a collection of texts. It provides valuable insights on how the word is used, its context, and its frequency. Some of its uses are literary analysis, language studies, translation and language learning, and authorship attribution.
